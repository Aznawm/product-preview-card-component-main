### What I learned

i learned how to add a favicon on a button and the hover effect.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<button class="hoover"><img src="images/icon-cart.svg"></img> Add to Cart</button>
```
```css
    button img, button svg {
            width: 20px; 
            height: 15px; 
            fill: #fff;
            margin-right: 5px;
        }
    .hoover:hover{
      background-color: rgb(4, 46, 4);
    }
```




### Continued development

i would like to begin implementing js in my projects.
